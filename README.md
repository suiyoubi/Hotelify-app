# Hotelify-app
Hotelify is a hotel booking platform that allows not user to have the best booking experiences but also hotel managers to mange their hotel better.
Hotelify-app is the Front-end of the Hotelify, which uses the AngularJS as the framework.

### How to Run it
* Make sure you have installed [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli)
* Make sure you have the Hotelify-php hosted as well
* ```npm install```
* ```npm start```
* You are good to go!
* By default, the website is hosted at ```localhost:8000```

### Note
If you are unable to run the application, you may need to change the url of the back-end in the code. By default, hotelify-app is trying to connect to ```http://localhost:8080/hotelify/public/index.php```, if this is not the back-end hosted url, please consider either changing the code (line31 of [app.js](app/app.js), also need to make sure the `/api` is here), or change your back-end url to be the same.
